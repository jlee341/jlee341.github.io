            <h2>How can I read?</h2>
    
            <p>Reading at its base level is quite simple, but knowing how to to read effectively depending on the text is a something that takes time to learn.</p>

            <p>reading books offers a multitude of benefits that contribute to personal, intellectual and emotional development. </p>

            <p>I think the biggest benefit from reading is that it improves your communication skills. Reading
                influences our way of thinking and speaking, by reading more advanced books that use a wide vocabulary, we can form complex, stronger sentences.
