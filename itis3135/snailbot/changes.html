<h1>Snailbot Changelog</h1>
<br>
<h2>February 12 2022 (v2.3)</h2>
<br>
<h3><strong>New Stuff</strong></h3>
<ul>
<br>
<li>
Rockstar Games has been added as a supported news provider.
</li>
<br>
<li>
    SnailBot now supports setting tag filters on RSS and Steam feeds. If a specific AppID or URL does not have any
known tags, you will not be prompted for tags.
</li>
<br>
<li>
    SnailBot should now be compatible
    with <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10952896421783">Slash Command Permissions 2.0.</a>
</li>
<br>    
<li>
    SnailBot now uses Discord's built in channel/role select menus when
     prompting a user to select a channel/role.
    </li>
<br>
<li>
    SnailBot will now keep track of the 25 most recently seen
    tags for a provider and auto populate a select menu for users to select tags with.
</li>
<br>
<li>
    new command has been added: <code>/editfeed</code>. You can use it to edit settings for any news
    configuration without having to redo the settings from scratch.
</li>
<br>
<li>
    Another new command was added: <code>/queue</code>. Use it to see if there are any news posts in the queue for your server.
</li>
<br>
<li>
    <code>/botstats</code> has a new stat: <code>Items In News Queue</code> will tell you how many news posts are queued to go out to servers.
</li>
<br>
<li>
    We've added support for sending news via webhooks in a attempt to reduce the amount of time it takes to send
 news out. In the coming weeks, we will be trying to migrate existing news configs to use webhooks. If SnailBot
  has the <code>Manage Webhooks</code> permission, a new <code>SnailBot News Post Helper</code> webhook will be created in any news channels
   used by SnailBot. Otherwise, it will fall back to the original news posting method.
</li>
<br>
<li>
    <code>/diagnose</code> and <code>/listfeed</code> will now show the status of webhooks for your enabled feeds.
</li>
<br>
<li>
    We now have a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/snailbotdiscord">Ko-Fi page.</a> If you'd like to support the work we do, we accept one-time donations
    and monthly memberships. Monthly memberships gives servers you choose priority when new news posts are
    available. We will never lock any core features behind Premium.
</li>
<br>
</ul>
<ul>
<h3>Internal Changes</h3>
<br>
<li>
SnailBot will now detect invalid news configurations
(language no longer supported, bad RSS/ATOM feed) and it will attempt to send out a service notification
 to let you know that it has been removed.
</li>
<br>
<li>
SnailBot will attempt to determine if a news channel actually no longer exists
 instead of blindly trusting that Discord reports a <code>404 Not Found</code> correctly before disabling a news feed.
</li>
<br>
<li>
The menu system has been reworked to perform better.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<code>/listfeed</code> is now less confusing when there are no enabled news feeds and a single page of feeds.
</li>
<br>
<li>
The languages list was getting too long, so <code>/showlanguages</code> now takes a <code>provider</code> parameter and autocompletes any supported provider in SnailBot.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Tag support was enabled for SMITE.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<code>/postnews</code> steam now properly checks if a provided AppID was actually an integer.
</li>
<br>
</ul>
<h3>Removed Features</h3>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
    Due to lack of use and effort required to migrate,
    the remaining mod tools have been removed from SnailBot.
     We recommend looking for another bot to do any logging you may need.  
</li>
<br>
<li>
Prefix support has been removed from SnailBot. Some basic commands still support being used via <code>@mentions</code>
(like <code>botstats</code> and <code>serverinfo</code>), but slash commands should be the preferred method of interacting with SnailBot.  
</li>
</ul>
