    <li>The provided link directed me straight to the relevant page for review.</li>
    <li>The filing appears to be in good order.</li>
    <li>Design:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>The page is easily legible.</li>
            <li>The page utilizes appealing colors and fonts through a well-structured CSS file.</li>
            <li>CRAP:
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Contrast: Some improvement could be made; there is a predominant use of black and light blue, and more variety is suggested.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: It's ok I feel like there should only be one font instead of two.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: The text alignment could use work with some of the images as well it just feels plopped in</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Objects within the page are appropriately spaced from each other.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The page encompasses all the mentioned elements.</li>
    <li>Yes, the header is enclosed within an H1 tag.</li>
    <li>Yes, it initiates with the page's name.</li>
    <li>No slogan is evident anywhere.</li>
    <li>Yes, it includes a proper footer.</li>
    <li>I am of the opinion that this website is well-designed and fulfills the specified requirements. It just needs some minor tweaks.</li>
